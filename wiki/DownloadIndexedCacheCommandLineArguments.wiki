#summary "Download Indexed Cache - Command Line Arguments"
== Command Line Arguments ==
"Download Indexed Cache" requires two command line arguments, specifically:
 # `-query` - Google Search Query
 # `-start` - Index of the First Search Result

For example, to retrieve the URL of "owasp.org" within the Google Cache being at Search Result 21 through to 31 `dic.pl -query owasp.org -start 21`

In addition, _site:_ will automatically be appended before the FQDN supplied for `-query` command line argument e.g. `-query owasp.org` becomes _site:owasp.org_.

In addition, `-start` is automatically converted to a zero based index i.e. _1_ becomes _0_.
